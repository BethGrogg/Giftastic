# Giftastic

This application shows 4 buttons with the names of tv shows on them.  When one of the buttons is clicked, 10 gifs related to that tv show display on the screen.  The application also offers the user an opportunity to add their own tv shows.  When they add a tv show to the text box and click the submit button, a new button with the name of that tv show is displayed with the other tv show buttons.  When the user clicks that button, it functions as the other tv show buttons, displaying 10 gifs related to that tv show.
